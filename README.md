# Hive
Companies today have a lot of data that needs to be stored securely and accessed frequently by multiple users in a quick and convenient manner. 

The proposed solution preserves a familiar user experience - Drag & Drop into a folder, and utilizes the unused storage space on the company's local computers to save the data. 

This approach is cost-effective compared to other solutions such as Cloud storage or NAS, does not require additional storage space or extensive maintenance, and is secure, as the data is kept within the company.

The project uses a Master-Minion architecture and is implemented at a RAID 0+1 level.

**The project is still in progress and not yet complete.**
